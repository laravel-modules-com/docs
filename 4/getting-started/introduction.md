`nwidart/laravel-modules` is a Laravel package which was created to manage your large Laravel app using modules. A module is like a Laravel package, it has some views, controllers or models. This package is supported and tested in Laravel 5.

This package is a re-published, re-organised and maintained version of [pingpong/modules](https://github.com/pingpong-labs/modules), which isn't maintained anymore. This package is used in [AsgardCMS](https://asgardcms.com/).

With one big added bonus that the original package didn't have: **tests**.

Find out why you should use this package in the article: [Writing modular applications with laravel-modules](https://nicolaswidart.com/blog/writing-modular-applications-with-laravel-modules).
